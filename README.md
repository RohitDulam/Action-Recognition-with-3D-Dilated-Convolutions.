# Action-Recognition-with-3D-Dilated-Convolutions.
This repository contains a 3D Convolutional Neural Network which contains dilated convolutions. This repo also contains another model trained on an intuitive loss function taken from Human Analogy. The paper associated with the project is also in the repo, which will help understand more about the loss function. Further experiments have to be done in order to prove the credibility of the loss function.

The file named Report contains the research paper consisting of the new Loss function and further details about the results. 

The models are run on UCF50 Action Recognition Dataset, and the Trainsplit and Testsplit files contains the training and testing splits.

Model-1 contains the 3D Dilated Convolutional Neural Network, and model 2 contains the model trained on the new Loss function. The proper details about the model and the loss function can be found in the Report.pdf file.
